Metadata is hidden or background information about digital content, such as the time a photo was taken, the location it was captured, the device used, or the author of a document.
Analyzing metadata helps investigators uncover details that are not immediately visible in the content itself.

This basically means to sum it all up is you can look at said data by doing some reaseaerch or putting it into a siite called metadata2go.com and find out rhe time 
location or said photo and where it was taken.
This is important becacause if you are trying to track someone down for whatever case it might be.
