QR Codes are images, intended to be scanned with a smartphone camera or otherwise, that are able to store data including automatic links and files.
They can be scanned using the browser tool [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/qr-code-scanner.php), which will show the information on a QR code.

Due to the fact that QR codes are able to download files in your stead, the biggest risk of QR codes are that it can download malicious software or bring the user to a website that downloads malicious software.

However, QR codes may be of use for finding keys for the competition, as they can be contained in plaintext, or behind a link as the first step into a multi-step process. They are also relatively easy to hide, given that the codes are only two colors.
