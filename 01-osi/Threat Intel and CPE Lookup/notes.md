# What is Threat Intel?

### Threat Intelligence is threat information that has been organized and analyzed to give Security Proffesionals in depth understanding of potential threats and how to stop them. 

### Threat Information is raw threat data.

## Key Characteristics:

### - Organization Specific - Focuses on the organization specific vulnerabilities, the attacks they enable and the assests they expose
### - Detailed and Contextual - Covers threat  actors, their techniques, tactics and procedures (TTPs) and Idicaters of Compliance (IOCs) that signal successful attacks.
### - Actionable - Gives informational insights that are used to address vulnerabilities, prioritize threats, remediate risks and improve overall security

## Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

### - Planning - Organizationa Stakeholders (those involved with cybersecurity in the organization) set intelligence requirements. These requirments are security questions asked by the stakeholders that must be answered, in regards to the safety and technological health of the organization.

### - Threat data Collection - Reseraching a security threat and collecting information on past attacks, tactics, and vuilnerabilities that were struck to exploit and infiltrate previous victims
 
### - Processing & Analysis - Threat data is aggregated, analyzed and correlated into threat intelligence.

### - Dissemination - Security team shares threat intelligence with stakeholders, allowing them to take further action to guard against security threats

### - Feedback - Stakeholders and security team reflect on recent threat intelligence life cycle to determine wether requiremenst were met

## Types Of Threat Intelligence

### - Tactical Threat Intelligence - 
### Helps Security Operations Center (SOCs) predict future attacks and better detect attacks in progress
### Commonly used to Identify IOCs, file hashes of known malware attacks or email subject lines of phishing attempts

### - Operational Threat Intelligence - 
### Used to identify threat actors, their tactics, behaviours and the common vulnerability exploits they use to target others, to determine secuiorty protocols and mitigation strategies

### - Strategic Threat Intelligence - 
### High Level intelligence about global landscape and how an organization falls within those threat scopes.
### Strategic Threat Intelligence gives decision makers unfamiliar with cybersecurty (CEOS, executives, etc) an overview of the cyber threats their organization faces.
